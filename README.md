This is an unnamed PHP portfolio CMS I was working back in the day. I was right in the middle of implementing Twitter OAuth (for some stupid reason). Got swamped with a whole bunch of work and never did get back to working on this.

Fun fact: This very CMS was one of the first things I ever discussed with @seangaffney. Beerdiots at [Barleyâ€™s](http://barleysgville.com), if I recall correctly.
